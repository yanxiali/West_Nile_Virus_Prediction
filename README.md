**Description**:
West Nile virus (wnv) is most commonly spread to humans through infected mosquitos. ~20% of people who become infected with wnv develop symptoms ranging from a persistent fever, to serious neurological illness that can result in death.

The City of Chicago established a comprehensive surveillance and control program. Every week from late spring through the Fall, mosquitos in traps across the city are tested for wnv. The results can then be used to help make decisions about when and where the city should spray airborne pesticides to control adult mosquito populations.

The objective of this project is to use the available datasets (weather, location, testing and spraying data) to build a model that can predict when and where different species of mosquitos will test positive for wmv. This can help the City of Chicago more efficiently and effectively allocate resources towards preventing transmission of this potentially deadly virus.
